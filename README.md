[![Unit Tests](https://github.com/Railgun-Community/poi-safe-broadcaster-example/actions/workflows/unit-tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Railgun-Community/poi-safe-broadcaster-example/actions)

# Example code and tests for PPOI-Safe RAILGUN transactions

Example code to forward RAILGUN transactions to the blockchain. Uses the Waku messaging protocol, while guaranteeing a Private Proof Of Innocence for all transactions.

`ppoi-safe-broadcaster-example` is a node.js application that receives encrypted transactions from RAILGUN wallets equipped with Private Proof Of Innocence. The Broadcaster example verifies, signs and forwards the transactions to the blockchain. It will broadcast fees on the tokens you configure to accept at the rates defined in the config.

## Private Proof Of Innocence

Private Proof Of Innocence is validated on every transaction for the safety of users and wallets.

Private Proof of Innocence is verified through a Proof Of Spendability, which verifies a merkle proof guaranteeing that the UTXOs that are spent are part of the Private Proof Of Innocence inclusion set for each list.

This means that every fee that is gathered is guaranteed to be spendable by your wallet - and RAILGUN wallets without Private Proof Of Innocence will not be able to use the broadcaster to forward any transactions.

## Waku Messaging

This network runs on [Waku](https://wakunetwork.com/), a secure and decentralized messaging protocol. Encrypted messages are sent over the private waku peer-to-peer network.

# Setup

## Requirements

- node 18+
- docker, if using docker
- jq (cli utility for parsing json)
- At least 1GB of RAM, at least 20GB of disk space

## Updating

# NOTICE 5/20/2024

- fetch the latest commmits from main branch
- run `./docker/stop.sh` if you're running the docker stack
- run `./broadcaster-update`
- run the update script as below or manually complete the needed steps as defined in the script

This will: (**_docker only_**)

- fetch the & update your local version of the repo.
- stop your current dockers.
- build new docker images.
- restart the docker stack.

```sh
./update #run from base directory
./update-swagless #for updating swagless docker instances
```

## Configuration Options

# 1. Quick Installer

This is intended as a setup-wizard for running in docker.

Only things required for setup are a capable system and a mnemonic to configure the broadcaster.

```sh
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/Railgun-Community/ppoi-safe-broadcaster-example.git

# change to repo directory
cd ppoi-safe-broadcaster-example

# May have to do this on a VPS
docker swarm init --advertise-addr PUT.IP.ADDR.HERE

# launch SETUP script
./docker/setup

# or If your server requires root privelages to run docker, ie: (aws, azure...)
# Prerequisites:
# 1. Generate a password, this is used to encrypt the railgun-databases
# 2. Mnemonic - best to copy/paste it. input will not show on screen. (protected input)
sudo ./docker/setup
```

This will setup 2 naku nodes & 1 broadcaster node.
Configure its base defaults, and launch.

## Useful Commands

- `./docker/stop.sh` - will kill the running docker-stack
- `./docker/run.sh` - will start up the swag instance (requires fully qualified domain name)
- `./docker/runswagless.sh` - will start up the swagless instance.
- `./docker/build.sh --no-swag` - will compile/rebuild the swagless docker-container after making any changes to code/config.
- `./docker/build.sh`- will compile/rebuild the swag docker-container after making any changes to code/config.

## Checking Docker Logs

##### these commands may need to be run with sudo

- `docker service logs broadcaster_broadcaster -f --raw` - displays running broadcaster logs
- `docker service logs broadcaster_nwaku1 -f --raw` - displays running nwaku node 1 logs
- `docker service logs broadcaster_nwaku2 -f --raw` - displays running nwaku node 2 logs

# 2. Manual Installation & Setup

### [NWAKU]

Create and edit docker/.env to define your environment. Start by copying docker/.env.empty to docker/.env, as this includes the needed fields.

      cp docker/.env.empty docker/.env

The fields to configure are described below. Note that you may leave the domain and email fields empty if not using a domain name.

- `EXTIP` - this is the IP address at which your system can be reached by the rest of the world
- `LISTENIP` - if your system has its own public ip, this is the same as `EXTIP`. If you are running inside docker or behind a router with NAT, this will be '0.0.0.0'

##### Required if running with Swag

- `BASEDOMAIN` - If your full domain were 'broadcaster.railgun.org, this would be 'railgun.org'
- `SUBDOMAIN` - If your domain were `broadcaster.railgun.org', this would be 'broadcaster'
- `TZ` - timezone code; eg 'EST'
- `EMAIL` - letsencrypt will generate an SSL certificate for your domain; an email address must be entered. Whether you enter a real email address or a fake one is up to you

### [BROADCASTER]

Customize your node by running `npm run copy-my-config`, which copies `src/MY-CONFIG.ts.example` to `src/MY-CONFIG.ts`.

#### Configuration

The standard configurations are set in config files in `src/server/config/`. All of these can be overridden in `src/MY-CONFIG.ts`. The following are the most common fields that you might want to edit.

- configDefaults.networks.active

Configure the networks on which you want to run a broadcaster. Simply add or remove networks from `configDefaults.networks.active`

```ts
import { ChainType } from '@railgun-community/shared-models';
import { NetworkChainID } from './server/config/config-chain-ids';

export const myConfigOverrides = () => {
//...
configDefaults.networks.active = [
    NetworkChainID.Ropsten,
    NetworkChainID.Ethereum,
    NetworkChainID.BNBChain,
  ];
//...

```

- configDefaults.waku.rpcURL

Specify a waku server to use for your broadcaster's p2p communication. It defaults to http://localhost:8546.

```ts
//...
configDefaults.waku.rpcURL = 'http://nwaku1:8546';
configDefaults.waku.rpcURLBackup = 'http://nwaku2:8547';
```

- configDefaults.wallet.mnemonic

Set the mnemonic used for the wallets

```ts
//...
configDefaults.wallet.mnemonic = 'word1 word2  ...';
```

- configDefaults.wallet.hdWallets

Set the derivation paths you want to use

```ts
//...
configDefaults.wallet.hdWallets = [
  {
    index: 0,
    priority: 1,
  },
];
```

- configNetworks

Set network provider

```ts
//...
configNetworks[ChainType.EVM][
  NetworkChainID.Ethereum
].fallbackProviderConfig.providers.unshift({
  provider: 'http://<IP>:<PORT>',
  priority: 1,
  weight: 1,
});
```

- configTokens

Set the tokens you want to accept as fees on each network.

```ts
//...
configTokens[ChainType.EVM][NetworkChainID.Ethereum]['0x_token_address'] = {
  symbol: 'TOKEN1',
};
```

## Manual Running Options:

### Docker stack

- Prereqs: Install docker
- Create the secret keys (`NODEKEY_1` & `NODEKEY_2`) for your node. This is not currently used for encryption, but does establish your node's identity: running `scripts/nodekey.sh` will generate these. (see below.)
- Know your external IP (`EXTIP`) and verify that ports 60000 and 8000 are exposed to the outside world (see https://www.canyouseeme.org/ or similar).
- If you have a stable ip and domain and would like to join the community fleet of bootstrap nodes, be sure to enter your `BASEDOMAIN` and optionally `SUBDOMAIN`. The `swag` service will automatically generate an SSL certificate for you through letsencrypt.

- Initialize docker swarm if you don't already have one:

      docker swarm init

- Generate `DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY` docker secret. Do not use password `sw0rdf1sh`. This is an example. Change it to your own. This command hashes your password to 32 bytes and wrangles it into the docker secret.

      echo "sw0rdf1sh" -n | sha256sum | awk '{print $1}' | docker secret create DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY -

- Generate `NODEKEY_1` & `NODEKEY_2` docker secrets:

```sh
      # step 1:
            ./scripts/nodekey.sh
      # this will generate NODEKEY
      # and fill them into .env if they're not already present.

      # Step 2:
            ./scripts/nodekey.sh --set-secret
      # This will run the above command, but store the secrets if they're already setup.
```

##### Manual Completion Example

```sh
echo "0xaf46f851e0d9c2f520c89ad95d67b5d098f1d79fae2fef3f562102eca9310a66" | docker secret create NODEKEY_1 -
echo "0x98f1d79fae2fef3f562102eca9310a66af46f851e0d9c2f520c89ad95d67b5d0" | docker secret create NODEKEY_2 -
# DO NOT USE this hash for your NODEKEY
```

- Register `MNEMONIC` docker secret. This is an example. Your actual mnemonic is not 'my mnemonic words...'

      echo "my mnemonic words..." | docker secret create MNEMONIC -

- Run `docker/build.sh` to build the `broadcaster` and `nwaku` docker images from your `docker/.env` environment definition. This will compose a 'swag' version (`creates SSL certs for DOMAINS, only needed if you're using a domain`) and one that just uses the `$EXTIP` for its nwaku visibility.

```sh
      ./docker/build.sh                 # builds the swag docker stack
      ./docker/build.sh --no-swag       # builds swagless docker stack
```

- Deploy stack with `./docker/run.sh`:
- Deploy `SWAGLESS` stack with `./docker/runswagless.sh`:

        $ ./docker/run.sh

        Creating network broadcaster_broadcaster
        Creating service broadcaster_broadcaster
        Creating service broadcaster_swag
        Creating service broadcaster_nwaku

If you get an error about the `broadcaster_broadcaster` network not existing, just execute `docker/run.sh` again until it works. This is a known issue with docker, but you may need to do it 5 times. Just press up instead of typing it again.

- Stop stack:

      docker/stop.sh

- View logs. append with `-f` to follow

      docker service logs broadcaster_broadcaster       # broadcaster logs
      docker service logs broadcaster_nwaku         # nwaku network node
      docker service logs broadcaster_swag          # letsencrypt generation

## Regular :

### 1. setup & start docker nwaku

- copy `docker/.env.empty` to `docker/.env` and fill in `EXTIP`, `NODEKEY`, `LISTENIP` (see above)

- build image and config.toml from your .env file:

      docker/build.sh

- run image interactively (useful for first setup): replace `$EXTIP` with your external IP.

      docker run -p 8546:8546 -p 60000:60000 -p 8000:8000 -it nwaku --config-file=./docker/nwaku/config.toml --nat="extip:$EXTIP" --nodekey=$NODEKEY  --websocket-support=true

- run image in background/detached: replace `$EXTIP` with your external IP.

      docker run -p 8546:8546 -p 60000:60000 -p 8000:8000 -d nwaku --config-file=./docker/nwaku/config.toml --nat="extip:$EXTIP"  --nodekey=$NODEKEY  --websocket-support=true

- verify that you can communicate with your nwaku instance over json-rpc:

`scripts/nwaku/whoami.sh`

- verify that nwaku is connected to other nwaku nodes:

`scripts/nwaku/peers.sh`

## Diagnostics

- run `./scripts/nwaku/whoami.sh` and see something like:

```
{
  "listenAddresses": [
    "/dns4/broadcaster.of.holdings/tcp/60000/p2p/16Uiu2HAmMUjGmiUhJeiZgu6ZZnLRkE2VViR2JgjqtW9aTZnHQqgg",
    "/dns4/broadcaster.of.holdings/tcp/8000/ws/p2p/16Uiu2HAmMUjGmiUhJeiZgu6ZZnLRkE2VViR2JgjqtW9aTZnHQqgg"
  ],
  "enrUri": "enr:-LO4QGvrbg2hqZnqdOFxGVZnDs9U2PWMkwfQUJdbjWixYkzUC8WOAkZXSlM3E4zxC-sh0yPcrYoiwrjooS2egIqnWnsBgmlkgnY0gmlwhKdH8B6KbXVsdGlhZGRyc5wAGjYTcmVsYXllci5vZi5ob2xkaW5ncwYfQN0DiXNlY3AyNTZrMaEDgxhTW1QQXUp6rmDAj8RflocYG0_fxiW9GnU_pzl_7XWDdGNwgupghXdha3UyDw"
}
```

- run `./scripts/nwaku/peers.sh` and see something like:

```
[
  {
    "multiaddr": "/dns4/node-01.do-ams3.status.prod.statusim.net/tcp/30303/p2p/16Uiu2HAm6HZZr7aToTvEBPpiys4UxajCTU97zj5v7RNR2gbniy1D",
    "protocol": "/vac/waku/relay/2.0.0",
    "connected": true
  },
  {
    "multiaddr": "/dns4/node-01.gc-us-central1-a.status.prod.statusim.net/tcp/30303/p2p/16Uiu2HAkwBp8T6G77kQXSNMnxgaMky1JeyML5yqoTHRM8dbeCBNb",
    "protocol": "/vac/waku/relay/2.0.0",
    "connected": false
  },
  {
    "multiaddr": "/dns4/broadcaster.railgun.org/tcp/60000/p2p/16Uiu2HAmNy49QzXVWHMdhz7DQHXCpk9sHvVua99j3QcShUK8PVSD",
    "protocol": "/vac/waku/relay/2.0.0",
    "connected": true
  }
]
```

- Monitor logs with commands like

  - `docker service logs broadcaster_nwaku`
  - `docker service logs broadcaster_broadcaster`
  - `docker service logs broadcaster_swag`

- In the event that services were restarted, the logs shown by the above commands may not be the true logs. If in doubt, execute:
  - `docker container ps`
  - This will show a list of running containers. The first column is the id of the container. You can generally refernce it with the first two characters of the id.
  - `docker logs 34` (where `34` are the first two characters of the container id)

```
